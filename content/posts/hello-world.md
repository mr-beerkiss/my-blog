# Hi there!

This is my `Hello World!` post to get a feel for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) 
and the release process for Netlify.

I've attempted _several_ blogs in the past, and never really found a good publishing rhythm.

Perhaps all the newness will help keep me interested. I've got a long laundry list of things I'd 
like to accomplish. Namely:

1. High PWA scores in Lighthouse
1. Using service workers for smart caching via [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/)
1. Gratuitous use of Web Components (basically just using all the cool [Google Web Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools))
1. Gratuitous use of [Web Assembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly)
1. [Integration](https://nb2hugo.netlify.com/post/blogging-with-jupyter-notebooks-and-hugo/) of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html)
1. Adding cool terminal recordings with [asciinema](https://asciinema.org)
1. Separating sentences with only a single space
1. Write a weekly blog post

You'd think for a blog site that last item would be higher on the list. Shows how crooked my 
priorities are.

I'm also very interested in machine learning (hence the bit about Jupyter Notebooks) but generally
have very little idea where to being.

Some of my co-workers at SEEK were working through Google's [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) 
but I was too many weeks too late when I heard about it to catch up.  Of course, if I had all the time 
in the world I would do all these things. Sadly I don't, but it never stopped me from trying. More
specifically, it never stopped me from _starting_ but often got in the way of me _finishing_. I'm
writing this in September 2019, so it might be a bit early for New Year's Resolutions but that would
be a good one. Not to have more time, that's impossible. But to get better at finishing stuff.

One a positive note I _did_ finish working through the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). 
Although admittedly but the time I was done the first few chapters had changed quite a bit since I first
read them... but I did finish it!

I need to think of a snappy sign-off line too. I feel like over the next decade catch phrases will 
be making a comeback in a big way. Although, to completely bastardise something Peter Thiel said in
["Zero to One"](https://www.audible.com.au/pd/Zero-to-One-Audiobook/B00XLUR4WS), you do want to be the 
first one to market with a catch phrase. You need to come in with the _best_ catch phrase into a 
market that is keen for an amazing catch phrase but so far has
only heard good ones.

Finally, I need to take a leaf out of [Marie Kondo's book](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/1607747308/) and clean up my digital life. The downside
of being an early adopter is my identity has been coopted by far too many eager start ups. They may
now longer exist but my password manager says otherwise. Don't even get me started on GitHub and
other online storage services. YIKES!
